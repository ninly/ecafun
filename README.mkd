# Elementary Cellular Automatons

We're just using MATLAB to perform some iterations of a user-specified
elementary cellular automaton (ECA). The user can provide a first row to
iterate from, or let the function generate a random initial state. Width
of the space and number of iterations can also be specified.

## Example

We'll just generate a few lines of celebrated Rule 30.

```matlab
>> wolframNumber = 30;          % corresponding to 0b00011110
>> N = 70;                      % iterations (rows)
>> M = 81;                      % space width (columns) 
>> firstRow = seedRow(M);       % start with a single cell "on"
>> field = ecaFun(wolframNumber,N,M,firstRow); % Go!
```
